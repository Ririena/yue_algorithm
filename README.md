# Yue Algorithm Monorepo

Welcome to my Algorithm Monorepo! This repository contains a collection of algorithms implemented in Python (and optionally JavaScript), along with documentation and examples for learning and practicing.

## Overview
This monorepo is designed to provide:
- Clear explanations of statistical and computational algorithms.
- Ready-to-run code examples for each algorithm.
- Simulations for real-life analogies (e.g., D&D dice rolls to explain data dispersions).

Algorithms included cover:
- **Dispersions**: Range, Variance, Standard Deviation, Interquartile Range
- **Monte Carlo Simulations**
- Other algorithms added over time (Sorting, Searching, etc.)
